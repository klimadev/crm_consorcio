# Operations Navigation

Core concept: Choose an operation by intent, then load its required reads before execution.

## Operations
- `harvest.md` - convert summaries into permanent context
- `extract.md` - build context from docs/code/URLs
- `organize.md` - restructure to function-based folders
- `update.md` - refresh context for version changes
- `error.md` - capture recurring failures and fixes

## Reference
- `../guides/workflows.md`
