# Organize Operation

Core concept: Organize restructures existing flat context into function-based directories without changing factual meaning.

## Key Points
- Move files by purpose, not by author or date.
- Add or update `navigation.md` at category root.
- Keep file names clear and stable.
- Do not delete during organize unless separately approved.
