# Context System Navigation

Purpose: quick entrypoint for context operations. Use this file to pick the right operation and required standards in under 30 seconds.

## Start Here
- `operations/harvest.md` - extract from summaries and clean workspace (with approval UI before cleanup)
- `operations/extract.md` - extract from docs, code, or URLs
- `operations/organize.md` - convert flat context into function-based structure
- `operations/update.md` - refresh context for version or API changes
- `operations/error.md` - capture recurring errors and fixes

## Standards
- `standards/mvi.md` - keep files under 200 lines with high signal only
- `standards/structure.md` - required folder layout by function
- `standards/templates.md` - compact templates for concepts, guides, lookup, and errors

## Guides
- `guides/workflows.md` - default operation flow and safety gates
- `guides/creation.md` - create a new context category correctly
- `guides/compact.md` - convert verbose files to MVI format

## Reference
- Workflow baseline: `guides/workflows.md`
